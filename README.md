# Description
This is a simple browser Tic-Tac-Toe game written in JavaScript.

# To do:
* Refactor: 
  I don't like GameController.switchPlayer, I can write it better than that.
  May be I should rethink EventsHandler to handle all the events!
  
* This game can be prettier, I should take an hour or two on the CSS
